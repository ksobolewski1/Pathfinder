**Pathfinder** 

This project implements Bowyer-Watson's Delauney triangulation algorithm to build a navigation mesh for a randomly generated obstacle course. It also implements the A* pathfinding algorithm to find a path between user-selected start and finish nodes. The visualisations are made with the SFML library.
